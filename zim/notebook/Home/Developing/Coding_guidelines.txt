====== Coding guidelines ======
Created Monday 26 November 2012

For the Zend/php part we use the zend coding guidelines as tested by phpcs. This is a coding standard based on an early Zend Framework coding standard.
see [[:Tools:Testing|Tools->Testing]]

For the java-part we use the coding convention for the Java Programming Language as described by [[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html|Oracle]]

For the jasper part (jrxml) we use the conventions as used by the community, 
@todo document this convention, maybe could use info from http://community.jaspersoft.com/questions/541964/ireport-developer-standards
