====== Coding guidelines ======

===== PHP =====
For the Zend/PHP part we use the Zend coding guidelines, based on an early Zend Framework coding standard.
Compliance can be tested with ''phpcs'', see [[:Tools:Testing|Tools->Testing]]

===== Java =====
For the Java part we use the coding convention for the Java Programming Language as described by [[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html|Oracle]]

===== Jasper JRXML =====
For the Jasper part (jrxml report definitions) we use the conventions as used by the community.
