====== i18n and l10n (multilingualism) ======
Created Wednesday 05 December 2012

The default language is English. Strings are translated by using Zend_translate
http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.translate.html
We use the gettext variant.
In application/translation/webenq4.pot we have a set of translatable strings. These strings are mostly harvest by scanning the code (.php and .phtml)for: 
setMessage, _ translate, setLabel, setLegend, _refresh, setValue, append, t
t is a method we wrote to perform the translation, customized for our needs.
Some strings are not found in the code (eg controller/methods used in user management). To be able to find those strings when we harvest the strings, we add these strings in a3pplications/translation/WebenqManualStrings.php. 

We use [[Tools:Poedit|poedit]] to  scan the code for translatable strings. These are stored in application/translations/webenq4.pot.
To translate, we use this file to scan for new strings.

=== zend_validate ===
We use zend-validate to validate forms we want to use the translations shipped with the zend-framework (https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/tree/master/resources/languages (assuming we use zf2)), but this is array based, so we combine multiple sources
