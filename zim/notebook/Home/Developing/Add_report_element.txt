====== Add report element ======
To add a report element, for example `text with info` (count number of respondents on a question):

* Make the new report element known to the system
	controller/ReportElementController: add case 'text with info'
	forms/ReportElement/Add.php: add type 'text with info'
    
* Define the needed information:
	forms/reportElement/Edit/TextWithInfo.php: wich info do you need for this report element
	application/views/helpers/ReportElement.php: which info do you want to show in view report
	application/view/scripts/report/jrxml/subreport/textWithInfo.phtml: add subreport definition
    
(the actual subreport was already defined)
