====== Developing ======

This section contains material on work flows, procedures, pseudo code definitions, and code guidelines for WebEnq functionality.

The [[:Tools|Tools section]] documents testing and deployment, as well as various tools in use.

===== URLs =====
Zend works with URLs in the format ''..../controller/action/key/value/key/value/...''
A Zend controller can call multiple actions:
* via front controler plugins via event hooks (start request, stop request)
* by putting controllers on a stack

===== PHPDoc =====
The code is documented through PHPDocumentor. You can generate an up-to-date version of that documentation with [[:Tools:Phing|Phing]]:

''phing doc-phpdoc''

We also have an [[../../phpdoc|online version of this PHP Documentation]].
