===== MySQL =====

==== Java connector ====
Pentaho community edition does not come with mysql connector jar. You need to download a recent version from the MySQL website. Alternatively, install the Ubuntu/Debian package libmysql-java and create symlinks:

''ln -s /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar mysql-connector-java.jar''

* BI server ''.../biserver-ce/tomcat/lib''
* PDI suite ''.../data-integration/libext/JDBC''
* Aggregation Designer ''.../aggregation-designer/drivers''
* Metadata Editor ''.../metadata-editor/libext/JDBC''
* Report Designer ''.../report-designer/lib/jdbc''
* Schema Workbench ''.../schema-workbench/drivers''

The database URLs are in the form ''jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databasename''

==== Tmp space ====
MySQL normally uses /tmp for temporary storage, which often resides on a special tmpfs file system of 2GB.
Analytical queries can require more space, which results in an "Errno 28" writing to a /tmp/... file.

Either increase the size of the tmp partition, or change the location of the tmp files in /etc/mysql/my.cnf
