====== Report Designer ======

===== Config =====
* Local configuration is stored in ''~/.pentaho''
* JNDI datasources are defined in ''~/.pentaho/simple-jndi/default.properties''

===== Datasets =====
A report can have multiple datasets, and multiple queries per dataset. But there can only be one "selected query" that provides the data for the report.

In order to use the other queries, you include subreports. They inherit the datasets and queries from the parent report, and can have their own "selected query".

===== Tips & tricks =====

==== Removing shadows in bar charts ====
In the bar chart properties under Scripting, add a post-processing script: language ''javascript'', code:
'''
plot = chart.getPlot(); 
renderer = plot.getRenderer(); 
renderer.setShadowVisible(false);
'''
