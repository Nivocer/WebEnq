====== Setup ======

===== Installation =====
All-in-one stack (includes a Tomcat server)
* Download the BI Platform from http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/COM/Latest+Stable+Builds (Business Intelligence Server, 4.8.0-stable)
* Unpack in destination location: this creates directories administration-console and biserver-ce
	* enable group write permissions: chmod -R g+w administration-console/ biserver-ce/
* Add the mysql connector java library (see below)
* Make sure connections on localhost to various ports are allowed in the firewall (at least 8005, 8009, 8080, 9001)

==== BI Server ====

=== Running in Java 7 ===
Java 7 is a bit more strict about custom sorts. This gives an error with Saiku answer label sorting. Fix this in start-pentaho.sh by adding to export CATALINA_OPTS:
	''-Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true''


=== Start-up ===
* go to the directory biserver-ce
* start via ./start-pentaho.sh
* available via http://localhost:8080/pentaho
* "evaluation login" user/password: joe/password
* Admin features via  http://localhost:8080/pentaho/Admin

=== Install Saiku ===
* within the Pentaho User Console, go to Tools > Marketplace
* install the Saiku Analytics plugin
* the Saiku plugin README says it is possible to let Saiku use the same Mondrian as the BI-Server, but it seems it already does this out-of-the-box?

==== Pentaho Administration Console ====

=== Start-up ===
* go to the directory administration-console
* start via ./start-pac.sh &
* available via http://localhost:8099/
* login: admin/password

===== mysql connector =====
Pentaho community edition does not come with mysql connector jar.

You need to download mysql-connector-java-5.1.20-bin. Alternatively, install the Ubuntu/Debian package libmysql-java and create symlinks:

''ln -s /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar mysql-connector-java.jar''

* BI server ''.../biserver-ce/tomcat/lib''
* PDI suite ''.../data-integration/libext/JDBC''
* Aggregation Designer ''.../design-tools/aggregation-designer/drivers''
* Metadata Editor ''.../design-tools/metadata-editor/libext/JDBC''
* Report Designer ''.../design-tools/report-designer/lib/jdbc''
* Schema Workbench ''.../design-tools/schema-workbench/drivers''

The database URLs are in the form ''jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databasename''
