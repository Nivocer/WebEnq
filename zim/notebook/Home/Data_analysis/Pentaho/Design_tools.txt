====== Design tools ======
Available via http://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files

===== Schema workbench =====

==== Setup ====
Schema workbench needs some additional files after unpacking:
* a recent MySQL java-connector in the directory drivers: 5.1.16 is too old, use 5.1.25 (package libmysql-java in a recent Ubuntu version) or 5.1.26 (can be downloaded from the MySQL website).

* JBoss javassist.jar in the lib/ directory, can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jboss/files/Javassist/
* Scannotation.jar in the lib/ directory, can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/scannotation/files/scannotation/
* Edit workbench.sh and add two lines at the end of setting the classpath variable (around line 48)
'''
CP="${CP}${PS}${MONDRIAN_HOME}/lib/scannotation.jar"
CP="${CP}${PS}${MONDRIAN_HOME}/lib/javassist.jar"
'''
(see also http://forums.pentaho.com/showthread.php?147289-java-lang-ClassNotFoundException-org-scannotation-AnnotationDB)

==== Config ====
Schema Workbench stores information on your local configuration in ''~/.schemaWorkbench''

* To use aggregates, edit mondrian.properties:
'''
mondrian.rolap.aggregates.Use=true
mondrian.rolap.aggregates.Read=true
'''
 

===== Metadata Editor =====
A metadata file (.xmi) in the root of a solution repository should be able to provide a lot of the information for various BI components.

==== Config ====
Local configuration is stored in ''~/.pentaho-meta'' (recovery versions of XMI files)
The metadata repository is stored within the application directory (files ''mdr.*'')
