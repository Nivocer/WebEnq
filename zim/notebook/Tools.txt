====== Tools ======

Overview of the various tools we use (see menu)

Our main git repository is hosted at Github and contains two major branches:
* ''master'' contains the code and accompanying detailed documentation on code and design
* ''gh-pages'' provides documentation for developers (and perhaps, in the future, for users)
