WebEnq Wireframes

We use Wireframesketcher to create wireframes, and export them to
interactive HTML models. It's based on Eclipse, and available as either a
plugin or as a standalone product.

It is not free, but does provide an open source SDK and an open XML format
for the wireframes.

Directories:

- assets: library of re-usable components and objects
- screens: individual screen layouts
- stories: combinations of screens delivering a user story
- html: generated interactive version (we add all screens to index.story and 
	export just that story to generate this version)

Wireframesketcher uses .settings/com.wireframesketcher.ui.prefs to store the
location of the 'assets' folder.
