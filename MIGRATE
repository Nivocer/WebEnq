Follow these steps if you want to make changes to the data model.

1.  Change the application/doctrine/schema/schema.yml
2.  Run "bin/doctrine generate-migrations-diff" on the command line
    to automatically generate migrations classes in
    application/doctrine/migrations. These classes reflect the changes
    between the current models and the changed schema file (YAML). 
3.  Run "bin/doctrine generate-models-yaml" to update the models in
    application/models/Base.
4.  Run "bin/doctrine migrate" to update the database.
