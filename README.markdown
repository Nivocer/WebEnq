Documentation WebEnq 4
======================

This is the documentation repository for WebEnq, based on Github's
gh-pages feature. See the documentation website at
http://doc.webenq.org

The source of the site is a Zim notebook (in zim/notebook) that is
exported as HTML (using the template in zim/template), to render most
of the website. The notebook has the most up-to-date version.
