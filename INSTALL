INSTALLATION
============

Command-line instructions to get webenq up and running.

PUT THE CODE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND CONFIGURE YOUR INSTANCE
===========================================================

In a directory of choice:
	cvs -d /home/cvs/nivocer co webenq4
	cd webenq4
	
Choose a name for your instance and set an environment variable APPLICATION_ENV
to that name. If APPLICATION_ENV is not set, 'production' will be used by default.
To set the APPLICATION_ENV variable put this in public/.htaccess

    SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV my-sandbox

Now set up the configuration for your instance. To do so, do NOT modify
application/configs/application.ini, but create a file named
application/configs/override.ini to set or overide configuration settings:

    [my-sandbox : production]
    db.dsn = "mysql://myname:secret@127.0.0.1:3306/webenq4"
	
or:
	
	[my-sandbox : production]
	db.host     = "127.0.0.1"
	db.port     = "3306"
	db.dbname   = "webenq4"
	db.username = "myname"
	db.password = "secret"
	
These examples will take the configuration settings from the section 'production' in
application/config/application.ini, then override it with the settigns from the section
'production' in application/config/override.ini, and then override it with the settings
in the section 'my-sandbox' in application/config/override.ini.

Note that if db.dsn is set all other db.* settigns will be ignored.


PREPARE THE DATABASE
====================

Manually create the database for your instance. Then populate it with an initial
set of data by running:

	cd bin
	./install
	
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS WILL DELETE ALL DATA FROM YOUR DATABASE!


RUN THE TEST SUITE
==================

To check the test suite:

	cd tests
    phpunit
    
The results will be available via .../tests/ at web location of your 
installation.
