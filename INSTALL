WEBENQ4

WebEnq4 can be used to manage questionnaires and report definitions, import
data sets, and generate reports in various formats. It is under active
development to be extended with more import and export options.

The application builds on a number of tools and technologies, most notably: 
PHP, Zend, PEAR, Java, Jasper, Ant

We use Xforms and Jasper's Jrxml to communicate between the core system and the
Jasper report engine.

INSTALLATION
============

Command-line instructions to get webenq up and running.

PUT THE CODE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND CONFIGURE YOUR INSTANCE
===========================================================

In a directory of choice:
	git clone https://github.com/Nivocer/webenq

	
Choose a name for your instance and set an environment variable APPLICATION_ENV
to that name. If APPLICATION_ENV is not set, 'production' will be used by default.
To set the APPLICATION_ENV variable put this in public/.htaccess

    SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV my-sandbox

Now set up the configuration for your instance. To do so, do NOT modify
application/configs/application.ini, but copy override.ini.sample to override.ini 
and adjust to set or override configuration settings:

    [my-sandbox : production]
    db.params.dsn = "mysql://myname:secret@127.0.0.1:3306/webenq4"
	
or:
	
	[my-sandbox : production]
	db.params.host     = "127.0.0.1"
	db.params.port     = "3306"
	db.params.dbname   = "webenq4"
	db.params.username = "myname"
	db.params.password = "secret"
	
These examples will take the configuration settings from the section 'production' in
application/config/application.ini, then override it with the settings from the section
'production' in application/config/override.ini, and then override it with the settings
in the section 'my-sandbox' in application/config/override.ini.

Note: if db.params.dsn is set all other db.params.* settigns will be ignored.


PREPARE THE DATABASE
====================

Manually create the database for your instance. Then populate it with an initial
set of data by running:

	./bin/install
	
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS WILL DELETE ALL DATA FROM YOUR DATABASE!

CHECK IMPROVE/WRITE PERMISSONS
==============================

Make sure the web server has write access to the following:

	logs/application.log
	java/tempout/test
	public/reports


GO TO THE WEB APPLICATION
=========================

You should now be able to access the application via the web server on the
location you installed it in, in the sub directory 'public'

Default username: admin
Default password: webenq



RUN THE TEST SUITE
==================

To check the test suite:

	cd tests
    phpunit
    
The results will be available via .../tests/ at web location of your 
installation.


JASPER SERVER
=============

(to be documented)
/application/controller/JasperController.php expects JAVA_HOSTS on localhost:8081
